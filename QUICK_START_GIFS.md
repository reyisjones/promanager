# Quick Start: Creating ProManager Demo GIFs

## ✅ What's Already Set Up:
- ✅ LICEcap installed (simple GIF recorder)
- ✅ ffmpeg installed (video to GIF conversion)
- ✅ GIF creation script (`scripts/create-gif.sh`)
- ✅ Detailed recording guide (`RECORDING_GUIDE.md`)
- ✅ README updated with GIF placeholders
- ✅ Development server should be running

## 🎬 Next Steps (You Can Do Now):

### 1. Check if your app is running:
Your Tauri dev server should be running. If not:
```bash
cd promanagerapp
pnpm tauri dev
```

### 2. Choose your recording method:

**Option A: LICEcap (Easiest)**
```bash
open -a LICEcap
```
1. Position the frame over your app
2. Click "Record"
3. Perform demo actions (see RECORDING_GUIDE.md)
4. Click "Stop" and save

**Option B: macOS Screen Recording**
1. Press `Cmd+Shift+5`
2. Select area and record
3. Convert using: `./scripts/create-gif.sh recording.mov demo-name`

### 3. Follow the demo scenarios (Priority Order):

**🎯 PRIORITY 1 - Main Demo:**
1. **ProManagerDemo.gif** - Complete app overview (25-30 sec)

**🎯 PRIORITY 2 - Feature-specific demos:**
2. **dashboard-overview.gif** - Show main dashboard (8-10 sec)
3. **project-management.gif** - Create new project (12-15 sec)
4. **task-management.gif** - Create and manage tasks (15-20 sec)
5. **task-filtering.gif** - Filter tasks by status/priority (10-12 sec)
6. **complete-workflow.gif** - End-to-end workflow (20-25 sec)

## 📁 File Organization:
```
assets/
├── ProManagerDemo.gif         ← MAIN DEMO (Create this first!)
├── dashboard-overview.gif     ← Feature-specific demos
├── project-management.gif     
├── task-management.gif        
├── task-filtering.gif         
└── complete-workflow.gif      
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria:
- Each GIF < 3MB file size
- Smooth 15 FPS animation
- Clear demonstration of features
- Professional appearance

## 💡 Pro Tips:
- Practice the actions first
- Move slowly and deliberately
- Keep recordings short and focused
- Use the optimization script for best quality
